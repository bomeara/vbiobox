=======

Virtual Biology in a Box (UTK) content. Developed by Thomas Jones of ETSU in collaboration with Susan Riechert (UTK) and others.

To see a working demo, go to http://ilab.engr.utk.edu/BOXERS/wwwroot/Default.html . Note that this is mostly initial proof of concept while seeking funding. 

The directory InitialUnityContent has all the content used initially to build the game, which we have released under an MIT license. This is just a dump of the entire Unity project for this game: scripts, assets, etc. It is rough prototype code, not intended to be shared, though we have chosen to make it open. Future work will incorporate version control in a fork of this project.
